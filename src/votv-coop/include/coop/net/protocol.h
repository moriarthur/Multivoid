// Rules of the file. kProtocolVersion is the build number of the version pair and bumps on
// every change a peer would parse differently and on every release. A retired wire value is
// never reused. Every reliable payload fits one datagram (kMaxReliablePayload) unless the
// session diverts the kind to the bulk sink. The direction, the trust and the late-join answer
// of each kind are stated at the kind; which lane it rides, whether the host relays a client's
// copy and whether it may be sent before the joiner's world exists are the tables in
// session_lanes.h. The subsystem pages under docs/ carry the why.
